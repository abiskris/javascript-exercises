// # Exercise 16 - Find the Oldest

// Given an array of objects representing people with a birth and death year, return the oldest person.

// Now that you've reached the final exercise, you should be fairly comfortable getting the information you need from test case(s). Take a look at how the array of objects is constructed in this exercise's test cases to help you write your function.

// ## Hints
// - You should return the whole person object, but the tests mostly just check to make sure the name is correct.
// - There are many ways of doing this using built-in array methods like `reduce`, or even chaining multiple! 
// - One of the tests checks for people with no death-date.. use JavaScript's Date function to get their age as of today.
